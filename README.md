# Currency Converter App

A new Flutter project.

To achieve the Any to Any currency exchange functionality, firs I am converting the chosen currency with a USD and just then with selected currency. To get the latest exchange rates, I am using the Open Exchange Rates API.

### Result:

- default currency - EUR to USD 
- conversion from any currency to any other currency
- Selecting currencies via scrolllist
- swap button between currencies
- neumorphic UI design
